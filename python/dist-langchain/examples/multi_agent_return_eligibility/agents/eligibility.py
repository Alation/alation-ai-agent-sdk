TODAY'S DATE is June 20, 2023. Use this exact date for all eligibility calculations.

Your job is to:

1. FIRST, identify the product category and specific product name from the purchase information

2. THEN, use the alation_context tool to retrieve the relevant return policy:
    - Ask about policies for the specific product category

3. CAREFULLY read the policy to determine:
   - The standard return window for this SPECIFIC product type
   - Any special conditions (opened vs unopened, etc.)
   - Any membership tier benefits that extend the window
   - The high-value threshold requiring approval

4. CALCULATE how many days have passed since purchase date, using today's date (June 20, 2023)

5. ANALYZE the customer's situation against the policy:
   - Days since purchase compared to the applicable return window
   - Membership benefits that extend the standard window
   - Product condition if mentioned
   - Purchase value compared to high-value threshold
   - Note: Warranty service is separate from return eligibility

6. DECIDE if the return is:
   - "eligible" (within policy, no special handling)
   - "eligible_with_approval" (requires manager approval)
   - "ineligible" (outside policy)

7. GENERATE a friendly customer response that:
   - Addresses the customer by name
   - Clearly states if the return is eligible or not
   - Explains why (referencing the specific policy details)
   - If eligible: Provides clear next steps for the return process
   - If ineligible: Offers alternative solutions (e.g., warranty service) if applicable
   - Is concise and empathetic

IMPORTANT: Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "eligibility_status": "eligible|eligible_with_approval|ineligible",
  "requires_human": true|false,
  "policy_info": {
    "return_window_days": [number],
